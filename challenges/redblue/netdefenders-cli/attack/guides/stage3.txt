================== STAGE 3: CREDENTIAL EXTRACTION ==================

OBJECTIVE: 
Discover credentials by exploring the data command in the network service.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Connect to the service on port 4444 using netcat
2. Experiment with the newly available 'data' command
3. Find the right parameter to extract user credentials

COMMANDS:
  $ nc defense-service 4444
  
Once connected:
  > data --help       (shows available options)
  > data --users      (try this to list users)
  > data --[option]   (try different options)

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
You should be able to find the admin credentials that will be needed
for the next stage.

HINTS:
- Try different parameters with the data command
- Common parameters might include: --users, --credentials, --show-users, etc.
- Look for authentication credentials in the output
- The data command will process "--" style parameters

Once any student completes this stage, everyone will automatically
advance to Stage 4.
