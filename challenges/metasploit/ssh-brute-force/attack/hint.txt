SSH BRUTE FORCE CHALLENGE - HINT

To complete this challenge, you'll need to use Metasploit's SSH login scanner module to perform a dictionary attack against the SSH server.

Here's how to get started:

1. In Metasploit, search for SSH-related modules using: search ssh

2. The module you want is auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login

3. When using this module, you'll need to set:
   - RHOSTS (the target IP/hostname)
   - USERNAME (the target username is "target")
   - PASS_FILE (the path to the password list file)

4. Remember that the password file is located at /home/kali/challenge/passwords.txt

5. After you find the correct credentials, connect with SSH and look for the flag file.

Good luck!
