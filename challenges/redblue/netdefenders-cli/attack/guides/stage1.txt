================== STAGE 1: INITIAL RECONNAISSANCE ==================

OBJECTIVE: 
Scan the defense system to identify available services.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use the provided scan-target.sh script to scan the defense system.

COMMANDS:
  $ scan-target

This will run a basic scan on the defense system to identify common services.

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
You should see several open ports, particularly port 4444 which hosts a
network service that we'll exploit in later stages.

HINTS:
- The default target is "defense-service", but you can set a custom target
  with: export DEFENSE_CONTAINER_HOST=<target_ip>
- When the scan completes, try connecting to port 4444 with:
  $ nc defense-service 4444

Once any student completes this stage, everyone will automatically
advance to Stage 2.
