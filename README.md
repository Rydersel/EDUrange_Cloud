# EDURANGE Cloud (WORK IN PROGRESS)

## [Public Documentation](https://docs.rydersel.cloud/)


### Introduction to EDUrange Cloud
EDUrange Cloud is a Kubernetes-powered, cloud-based cybersecurity education platform and framework that allows users to easily and efficiently host their own cybersecurity competitions (CTFs) and exercises. Originally focused primarily on hosting capture the flag competitions (CTFs), the scope of EDUrange Cloud has evolved to include support for cybersecurity demos and other educational exercises. This evolution allows for a broader range of educational opportunities within the platform.

EDUrange Cloud was created as a cloud alternative to the existing EDUrange software, leveraging the power of Kubernetes to create an efficient yet highly modular cybersecurity education framework. This modularity allows users to customize their instance with various educational tools and resources. 

### No Local Setup Required
One of the core design philosophies of EDUrange Cloud is that no software installation is required by the end user. Traditional cybersecurity education frameworks often require users to complete challenges on their own devices, which can lead to significant time spent debugging due to the diverse set of computers and operating systems typically found in a classroom setting.

With EDUrange Cloud, everything is set up for the user straight out of the box. Thanks to the integrated WebOS, users simply need to navigate to a URL to start their exercises. This eliminates the need for complex local setups and ensures that all students have a consistent and functional environment, allowing educators to focus on teaching rather than troubleshooting technical issues.
