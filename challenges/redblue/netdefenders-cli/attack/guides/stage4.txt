================== STAGE 4: COMMAND INJECTION ==================

OBJECTIVE: 
Exploit command injection vulnerability in the 'run' command.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Connect to the service on port 4444 using netcat
2. Use the admin credentials discovered in Stage 3
3. Authenticate with the 'login' command (which is now available)
4. Exploit the 'run' command to execute arbitrary system commands

COMMANDS:
  $ nc defense-service 4444
  
Once connected and authenticated:
  > login admin [password]   (use the credentials from Stage 3)
  > run [command]            (try running authorized commands)
  > run backup               (a legitimate command)
  > run status               (another legitimate command)
  > run backup; ls           (try command injection)

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
You should be able to inject arbitrary shell commands after a legitimate
command by using shell command separators like ";", "&&", or "|".

HINTS:
- Common command separators include: ; && | || $(command)
- Try injecting simple commands like 'ls', 'id', or 'whoami'
- Once you can execute commands, try exploring the system
- Look for ways to enumerate directories and files

The goal is to get command execution on the system to advance to the
final stage.

Once any student completes this stage, everyone will automatically
advance to Stage 5.
